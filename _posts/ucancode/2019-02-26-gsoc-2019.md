[Google Summer of Code (g.co/gsoc)](http://g.co/gsoc) is Google's summer program for university students to learn about, and get involved in open source. 
It's happening again for the 15th year in 2019! Over 14,762 students from 109 countries have participated.

Google Summer of Code is a unique program where students are paired with a mentor to introduce them to the open source community and provide guidance while they work on a real world open source project during their summer break from university. Projects cover a wide range of fields including: Cloud, Operating Systems, Graphics, Medicine, Programming Languages, Robotics, Science, Security and many more. This is not an internship but still provides an invaluable experience and looks great on a resume!

The application period opens on March 25, 2019 and ends on April 9th, 2019. It's a highly competitive program (and this year is expected to be even bigger than last year), so don't wait to the last minute to prepare!
